 The following program can be compiled using the following command:

 	make

 It can be run using the following command:

 	make run

 The program will then show a list of options for the user to choose from.
 In order to choose an option, the user must enter the letter given for
 the command: 'A' for malloc()/free(), 'B' for my_malloc()/my_free(),
 or 'X' to exit, then press ENTER to run the command. After the user chooses
 an option, the program will run with the functions associated with the
 command. If the user wants to change the size of the limit to hold the 
 memory slots for the processes, they can change the global value on
 Line # 12 of "process_gen.cpp".
